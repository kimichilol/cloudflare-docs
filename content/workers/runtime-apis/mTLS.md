# Client authentication with mTLS

When using [HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/), a server presents a certificate for the client to authenticate in order to prove their identity. For even tighter security, some services require that the client also present a certificate.

This process - known as [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) - moves authentication to the protocol of TLS, rather than managing it in application code. Connections from unauthorized clients are rejected during the TLS handshake instead.

To present a client certificate when communicating with a service, upload and bind a certificate and its private key using the [`wrangler mtls-certificate`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#mtls-certificate) command:

```sh
wrangler mtls-certificate upload --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```

Add the certificate to your `wrangler.toml` to bind your Worker project to the certificate:

```toml
mtls_certificates = [
  { binding = "MY_CERT", certificate_id = "<CERTIFICATE_ID>" } 
]
```

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Certificate IDs are displayed after uploading, and can also be viewed with the command `wrangler mtls-certificate list`.

mTLS certificate bindings use the standard [Fetch](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) API, similar to [service bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/service-bindings). Binding to an mTLS certificate includes a variable on which the `fetch()` method is available. The `fetch()` method has the exact same signature as the [global `fetch`](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/), but always presents the client certificate when establishing the TLS connection.
